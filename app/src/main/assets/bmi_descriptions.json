  "Underweight": "Being underweight may indicate that you're not getting enough nutrients to fuel your body. It's essential to ensure you're eating a balanced diet to support your health and well-being. If you're concerned about your weight, consider speaking with a healthcare professional to address any underlying issues and develop a plan to achieve a healthier weight.",
  "Normal weight": "A normal weight BMI (18.5 to 24.9) suggests a weight that is generally considered healthy for a given height, minimizing the risk of weight-related health issues. However, it's important to note that BMI doesn't account for factors like muscle mass, bone density, and distribution of fat, so it may not perfectly reflect an individual's health status. Maintaining a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and overall healthy lifestyle habits are key to supporting your well-being regardless of your BMI.",
  "Overweight": "Being overweight suggests that you may be carrying excess body fat, which can increase the risk of various health issues such as heart disease and diabetes. While BMI is a useful screening tool, it's important to remember that it doesn't provide a complete picture of your health. Consider incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into your diet, along with regular exercise, to achieve a healthier weight and reduce your risk of weight-related health problems.",
  "Obesity": "Obesity significantly increases the risk of serious health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. If your BMI falls into the obese category, it's essential to prioritize your health by making sustainable lifestyle changes. This may include working with a healthcare provider to create a personalized plan for weight management, incorporating regular physical activity, and making dietary adjustments to support long-term health and well-being. Remember that small changes can lead to significant improvements in your health over time."
